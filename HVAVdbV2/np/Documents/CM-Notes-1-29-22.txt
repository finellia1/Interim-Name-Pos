Jorge - Interest in leading, scotty pippen, facilitator, ready to take the mic and the wheel to back me up/help me out,
or advocate for others in group. Will take point on teacher student relations/outreach as is reasonable.
Tai - Has leadership experience, is more interested in knocking things out and being put to a task on this project.
He is willing to be something of a consultant, and a person who can 
help you out of a jam if youve put the work in, have a coherent question ready, etc. 
He said hes take care of discord, but im going to clarify with everyone that we shouldnt run every innane change or 
request through him if we can take care of it ourselves.
Nick and Antonio- Comfortable leading, and clearly ready. I think they will choose their spots well, and let thier intentions be known.
Asfand - Quieter but thoughtful. Seems to be a solid mix of wanting direction and structure, while still have a domain to be expressive and work out his ideas.
I think it is important we listen to asfands ideas when we are taking the lead because the people who say less are often more thoughtful.
Chris - group lead, Learner. Can organize but needs to take on role of learner, facilitator, programmer, actively.
Does not want to slip into unbalance where adminstrative tasks overtake coding tasks. Must stay familiar with code, and take on programming tasks.

I need to compile notes on each person sperately and run it by them for accuracy.

Asfand to email denizard short term with questions on asana, 
and set up first meeting medium term(after monday where we may try and find availability)

People are excited about graphic design, and i stink at that so im hoping someone wants the wheel on it

These are my notes. They do not cover all business.
